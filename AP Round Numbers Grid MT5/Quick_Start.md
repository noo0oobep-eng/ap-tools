# AP Round Numbers Grid (MT5) — Quick Start

**What it is:** A lightweight, non-trading overlay that draws horizontal grid lines every *step (points)*. Optional half and quarter levels help you see reaction zones at round prices.

## Install & Use
1. Attach the indicator to any chart.
2. Set **Step (points)**:
   - 5-digit FX: `500` ≈ 50 pips, `1000` ≈ 100 pips, etc.
   - For other symbols, check *Symbol specification* to see how many points equal a “round” amount.
3. Toggle **Show half levels** and **Show quarter levels** as needed.
4. Adjust **colors**, **widths**, and **Style** (dot/dash/solid).
5. Housekeeping:
   - **Back**: draw behind candles,
   - **Hidden**: hide from Objects list,
   - **Unselectable**: prevents clicking the lines.
6. Keep **Max lines** reasonable to avoid clutter when zooming out.

## Tips
- Start with a clean theme and subtle colours for screenshots.
- Increase line width slightly for presentation or reduce it for trading.
- Quarter lines are great for finer entries; hide them when you only want the big “handles”.
