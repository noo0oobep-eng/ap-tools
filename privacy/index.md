# Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** 21 Sep 2025  
Contact: **noo0oobep@gmail.com** (AP Trading Tools)

We sell downloadable Expert Advisors (EAs) and indicators. We keep the minimum data needed to deliver your order and support you.

## What we collect
- **At checkout (via Lemon Squeezy):** name, email, billing address/country, IP (fraud prevention), order details.  
  **Cards are processed by Lemon Squeezy** — we never see or store full card numbers.
- **Support emails:** your email address and whatever you send us (screenshots, logs).
- **Site:** basic server logs for reliability (IP, user-agent) and the Lemon Squeezy checkout script may set cookies to run the payment modal.

## How we use data
- Deliver downloads, receipts, and updates related to your purchase
- Provide support and product fixes
- Detect fraud/abuse and comply with tax/accounting laws

## Lawful basis
- **Contract:** to provide your purchase and support  
- **Legitimate interests:** fraud prevention, improve products  
- **Legal obligation:** tax/accounting record-keeping

## Sharing
We share only with service providers needed to run the store:
- **Lemon Squeezy, LLC** (checkout, payment processing, order delivery)  
- Email provider (sending/receiving support mail)

We don’t sell or rent your data.

## International transfers
Orders may be processed in the **United States** and other locations by our processors (e.g., Lemon Squeezy). They use appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs).

## Data retention
- Order records: kept as long as required for tax/accounting (usually up to 7 years)
- Support threads: kept as long as needed to assist you, then periodically deleted

## Your rights
You can **access, correct, or delete** your personal info (within legal limits).  
Email **noo0oobep@gmail.com** with your request and order email.

## Security
We don’t store card numbers. We use reputable processors and take reasonable steps to secure data.

## Changes
We’ll update this page if the policy changes and note the new effective date.
