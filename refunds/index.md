# Refunds & Returns
**Last updated:** 21 Sep 2025  
Contact: **noo0oobep@gmail.com**

Our products are **digital downloads** (MT5/MT4 EAs & indicators). Once a file is delivered, it can’t be “returned” like a physical good. To be fair and helpful, we follow the policy below.

## All sales are final — with a practical guarantee
If you experience a **technical issue** that prevents the EA from working on a **supported platform/broker** and we **cannot resolve it within 7 days** from your purchase **after you contact support**, we’ll offer a **full refund**.

### What “supported” means
- Platform: MT5 (or MT4 if specified on the product page)
- Chart/timeframe/instrument types the EA is designed for (see Docs)
- Broker imposes reasonable trade/stop levels and allows required order types

### Not covered
- Strategy performance or profit expectations  
- Backtest results that differ from live trading (spread/latency/liquidity)  
- Incorrect install, custom code changes, or use outside the documented scope  
- Purchases older than **7 days** or orders made under different/invalid emails

## How to request help/refund
Email **noo0oobep@gmail.com** within **7 days** of purchase and include:
- Order number and product name
- Platform (MT5/MT4), broker, symbol, timeframe
- Steps to reproduce the issue + screenshots and any errors (Experts/Journal)

We’ll work with you quickly. If we can’t get it working on a supported setup, we’ll refund you.

## Updates and replacements
If we fix a bug, we’ll provide an **updated build** or replacement at no extra cost for the same product line/version.

## Chargebacks
Please contact us first. Unwarranted chargebacks for working products may lead to license/updates being revoked for that order.
