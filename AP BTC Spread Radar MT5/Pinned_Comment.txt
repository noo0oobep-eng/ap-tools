AP BTC Spread Radar (MT5) – Pinned Comment
Lightweight panel that shows the live spread (points) for the current symbol, plus an optional moving-average baseline so you can see when spread is unusually high or calm. Great for BTC pre-trade checks and screenshots.

How to use

Attach to the symbol you trade (any timeframe).

Set MA_Period for the spread baseline (set to 0 to hide).

Optional: enable ShowComment and choose CommentEvery for how often the HUD updates.

Reading the numbers

The value is in points. On many BTC symbols 10,000 pts ≈ $1 (check your broker).

If current spread >> MA spread, conditions are expensive/illiquid; you may wish to delay entries or reduce size.

Notes

Works on any symbol; designed with BTC in mind.

Very low resource usage; safe to leave running.

If you ever see 0 spread, ensure the market is open and ticks are coming in.
