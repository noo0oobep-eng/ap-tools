# VPS Setup (MT5)

**MT5 built‑in VPS**  
1) Right‑click your account in **Navigator** → **Register a Virtual Server**.  
2) Attach EA locally and load your preset; ensure **AutoTrading = ON**.  
3) Right‑click the account → **Migrate → Expert Advisors and Signals**.  
4) Verify on the VPS Journal that the EA is running with your inputs.

**Tips**
- Keep charts light. Avoid frequent preset changes during London session.
- Re‑migrate after any input change.
- Monitor spread around placement time; adapt `InpMaxSpreadPoints` per symbol.
