**Quick Start**
1) Attach to symbol (M5/M15). **Convert 07:00–08:00 to your broker server time.**
2) Set `BufferPoints`, `SL extra`, and `TP R multiple` (or load a preset).
3) Keep `CancelOppOnFill = false` for validator; rely on expiry.
4) Ensure spread/margin OK at placement.

**Support:** Send preset `.set`, broker/symbol/TF, Experts/Journal, and a screenshot with the box visible.
